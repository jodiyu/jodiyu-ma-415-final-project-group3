INSTNM: institution name\n\n3. CITY: the name of the city where the institution is located\n\n4. STABBR: the name of the state where the institution is located\n\n5. starts_with(\"SAT\"): some variables related to SAT scores of students\n\n6. starts_with(\"ACT\"): some variables related to ACT scores of students\n\n7. starts_with(\"NPT\"): the average net price of each institution\n\n8. LO_INC_ENRL_ORIG_YR3_RT: Percent of low-income (between $30,000 and $75,000 in nominal family income) students who were still enrolled at original institution within 3 years.\n\n9. MD_INC_ENRL_ORIG_YR3_RT: Percent of middle-income (between $30,000 and $75,000 in nominal family income) students who were still enrolled at original institution within 3 years.\n\n10. HI_INC_ENRL_ORIG_YR3_RT: Percent of high-income (between $30,000 and $75,000 in nominal family income) students who were still enrolled at original institution within 3 years.\n\n\n# Plot for relationship between SAT Scores and Completion Rate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neducation_cohort_data_cleaned <- read_rds(\"dataset/education_cohort_data_cleaned.rds\")\nggplot(education_cohort_data_cleaned, aes(x = SAT_AVG, y = C150_4)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between SAT Scores and Completion Rate\",\n    x = \"Average SAT Score\",\n    y = \"Completion Rate (%)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 5406 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](blog_post3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nComment: We expect to see a positive correlation, as higher SAT scores often correlate with higher institutional success rates. By plotting these two variables, we can check if the data behaves as expected or if there are unusual trends or outliers.",
