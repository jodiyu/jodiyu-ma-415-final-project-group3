# Data cleaning rationale
Selected some columns of the original big dataset:
1. starts_with("C150_4"): the different types of completion rate for each race
2. INSTNM: institution name
3. CITY: the name of the city where the institution is located
4. STABBR: the name of the state where the institution is located
5. starts_with("SAT"): some variables related to SAT scores of students
6. starts_with("ACT"): some variables related to ACT scores of students
7. starts_with("NPT"): the average net price of each institution
8. LO_INC_ENRL_ORIG_YR3_RT: Percent of low-income (between $30,000 and $75,000 in nominal family income) students who were still enrolled at original institution within 3 years.
9. MD_INC_ENRL_ORIG_YR3_RT: Percent of middle-income (between $30,000 and $75,000 in nominal family income) students who were still enrolled at original institution within 3 years.
10. HI_INC_ENRL_ORIG_YR3_RT: Percent of high-income (between $30,000 and $75,000 in nominal family income) students who were still enrolled at original institution within 3 years.


# Plot for relationship between SAT Scores and Completion Rate
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
education_cohort_data_cleaned <- read_rds("dataset/education_cohort_data_cleaned.rds")
ggplot(education_cohort_data_cleaned, aes(x = SAT_AVG, y = C150_4)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between SAT Scores and Completion Rate",
    x = "Average SAT Score",
    y = "Completion Rate (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Comment: We expect to see a positive correlation, as higher SAT scores often correlate with higher institutional success rates. By plotting these two variables, we can check if the data behaves as expected or if there are unusual trends or outliers.
