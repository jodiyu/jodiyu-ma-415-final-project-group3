For this blog, we are working on data set 2 to build some research questions and do data cleaning.
1. Where does the data come from? Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source?
2. Are there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?
3. How is this data used? Has there been other research on the same data? Is this data being used for some policy decisions? What questions have others ask about this data?
