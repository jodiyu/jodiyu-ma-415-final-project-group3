For this blog, we are working on data set 2 to build some research questions and do data cleaning.
1. Where does the data come from? Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source?


2. Are there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?


3. How is this data used? Has there been other research on the same data? Is this data being used for some policy decisions? What questions have others ask about this data?

- Since this dataset contains a wide range of information about institutions in the United States, including data on enrollment, financial aids, students' demographic etc, the government might use this dataset to support decisions on how funding is allocated to institutions and student aid program. - The study Buyer Beware, analyzed first year earnings and debt for 37000 college majors across 4400 institutions. The findings highlighted variations in earnings, showing that students with the same degree and major can experience salary differences of up to $80000 depending on the institution they attended.
- "We need a system thatâ€™s inclusive, that delivers value, and that produces equitable outcomes. We need transparency in data more now than ever before." said by Secretary Miguel Cardona. Indeed, this data not only helps the Department of Education to support the equity in education, but also emphasize transparency in college outcomes, helping students avoid institutions with poor return on investment.
- One question that is being asked based on this dataset is What is the relationship between student debt and post-graduation earnings?
